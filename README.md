## Work in Progress

Basic Tab aims to be a basic tab application for small restaurants or bars.

## What will this application do?
It will be possible to take the customer's order and send it to the kitchen to prepare it, after the order is ready it will be possible to follow it on a specific screen so that the order is removed from the kitchen and taken to the customer.
Finally, it will be possible to close the customer's account directly through the application.
